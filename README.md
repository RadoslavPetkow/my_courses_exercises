# 📚 My Programming Journey: Exercises and Course Presentations

Welcome to my repository! This is where I am collecting and organizing all the exercises, projects, and presentations from the various courses I’ve taken over the years. As a student pursuing a **Software Engineering** career, I believe it’s essential to have everything in one place—both for knowledge refreshment and for showcasing the hard work and dedication I've put into learning.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- **Organize**: Keep track of all the exercises from different courses I’ve completed.
- **Refresh**: Revisiting old material is a great way to refresh and deepen my understanding.
- **Learn**: Continue building on what I’ve learned by practicing and applying concepts.
- **Share**: Present my journey in a structured way for others who might find it useful.

## 🚀 Future Updates

I’ll keep adding:
- More exercises as I revisit them.
- Presentations or summaries from each course.
- Solutions to coding challenges and algorithms.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to check out the materials, and if you have any suggestions or tips for improving the code, I’m open to feedback and collaboration!
